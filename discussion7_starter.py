    Returns:
        nested dict structure from csv
        outer keys are (str) years, values are dicts
        inner keys are (str) months, values are (str) integers

def get_annual_max(d):

    Params:
        d, dict created by load_csv above

    Returns:
        list of tuples, each with 3 objects: year (str), month (str), and max (int) 
        max is the maximum value for a month in that year, month is the corresponding month

    Note: Don't strip or otherwise modify strings. Do not change datatypes except where necessary.
        You'll have to change vals to int to compare them.

    Params: 
        d, dict created by load_csv above

    Returns:
        dict where keys are years and vals are floats rounded to nearest whole num or int
        vals are the average vals for months in the year

    Note: Don't strip or otherwise modify strings. Do not change datatypes except where necessary. 
        You'll have to make the vals int or float here and round the avg to pass tests.
